# 🚨 Disaster Management Tool

A **Java console-based application** for simulating emergency response planning and decision-making using **graph-based shortest path analysis**. This tool models a network of cities and critical infrastructure — such as **hospitals, schools, fire stations**, etc. — and uses **Dijkstra's algorithm** to compute the shortest and most efficient routes between them.

This project can assist in disaster response scenarios like identifying the quickest path for ambulances, fire brigades, or rescue teams.
